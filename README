Welcome to BitleSpeak 
---------------------

First beta July 1, 2010

  BitleSpeak is a minimalist text to speech toolbar for UNIX like operating 
systems. BitleSpeak has all the basic features of a tts front end, with more
advanced features like mp3 encoding, and follow along highlighting coming
in the near future. In addition to being actively developed, Bitle has one other
advantage over other speech toolbars, that is the ability to support multiple 
speech engines, and audio subsystems. No more dreading machines with 
pulseaudio; just set it and forget it. Note this is not a full screen reader
it only reads text from within documents, and web-pages. If you need a screen
reader get Orca.

Dependencies
------------

To run BitleSpeak you need 
python v 2.6 (should work with v 2.5 also)
pygtk v 2.17 or higher (may work with 2.16 test this let me know)

A Supported Speech back-end configured 

Supported Speech Backends
------------------------

* Speech Dispatcher/OpenTTS: plugin (bitle.SSIPClient)
* festival: WARNING THIS IS REALLY UNSTABLE: (plugin bitle.FestivalClient)


How to use
----------

Just run the setup.py install copy the stock config file to ~/.bitle.cf
read said file and edit to your heart's content. With development builds 
just edit the stock config file, and ./bitlespeak.py. 
Also if you have dev build report bugs, or better yet fix bugs yourself.


THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BUILD
---------------------------

In fact it's the first ever development build, you are lucky. Not only do you
get to see seemingly random debug messages spew into the terminal, but 
random features won't work as they were intended to. If you notice 
and are bothered by these things you should e-mail the author aka me
at the e-mail address in Contact information below. Here are some bugs 
I'm currently working on

* The preferences button doesn't work 
* The loader spits up FestivalClient
